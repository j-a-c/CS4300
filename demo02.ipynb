      "Robert Kardashian (1944\u20142003) and Kristen Mary \"Kris\" Houghton (born 1955) married in 1978 and had four children together, daughters Kourtney (born 1979), Kim (born 1980), and Khlo\u00e9, (born 1984), and son Rob (born 1987). The couple divorced in 1991.[3] In 1994, Robert entered the media spotlight when he defended O.J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman during a lengthy trial. Kris married former Olympic champion Bruce Jenner (born 1949) in 1991. Bruce and Kris had two daughters together, Kendall (born 1995) and Kylie (born 1997). Robert died in 2003 eight weeks after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer.[4] In 2004, Kim became a personal stylist to recording artist Brandy Norwood; she eventually developed into a full-time stylist, and was a personal shopper and stylist to actress Lindsay Lohan.[5] Khlo\u00e9, Kim and Kourtney further ventured into fashion, opening a high fashion boutique D-A-S-H in Calabasas, California. Throughout Kim's early career, she involved herself in some high-profile relationships including Norwood's brother, rapper Ray J and later, singer Nick Lachey.[5] In 2006, Kourtney starred in her first reality television series, Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive.[6] In February 2007, a home sex video that Kim made with Ray J years earlier was leaked.[7] Vivid Entertainment bought the rights for $1 million and released the film as Kim Kardashian: Superstar on February 21.[7] Kim sued Vivid for ownership of the tape, but dropped the suit in April 2007 and settled with Vivid Entertainment for $5 million.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "In August 2007, it was announced that the Kardashians and Jenners would star in a yet-to-be-titled reality show on E!, with Ryan Seacrest serving as executive producer.[6] Seacrest said \"At the heart of the series\u2014despite the catfights and endless sarcasm\u2014is a family that truly loves and supports one another [...] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain.\" The series announcement came one week after Paris Hilton and her friend Nicole Richie announced that their popular E! series entitled The Simple Life was ending.[6] Keeping Up With the Kardashians premiered on October 14, 2007.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "On November 13, 2007, it was announced that E! renewed the show for its second season.[9] The following year, it was renewed for a third season. Lisa Berger, executive vice president of original programming and series development for the network, said \"viewers have embraced the Kardashian family and the series has become one of television's most-talked-about shows [...] We are fortunate to work with Seacrest and Bunim-Murray, which have an exceptional ability to capture the Kardashians' hilarious, chaotic and always entertaining personalities and family dynamics.\"[10] The Hollywood Reporter reported that the family made an estimated $65 million throughout 2010.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2011, Kim married NBA player Kris Humphries in a highly publicized wedding ceremony,[11] but filed for divorce 72 days later.[12] This caused widespread backlash from the public and media.[13] Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt, to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.[14] A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air has followed since their split.[15] As of December 2013, eight seasons of the series have aired. On April 24, 2012, E! signed a three-year deal with the Kardashian family that will keep the series airing through seasons seven, eight and nine.[16] The deal was estimated at $40 million.[17][18] On January. 4, 2015, a tenth season was announced to premiere on Feb 8, 2015 after the Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take The Hamptons season finale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The show revolves around the children of Kris Jenner, and originally focused on her children from her first marriage to deceased attorney Robert Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob Kourtney's boyfriend Scott Disick is a main character on the show. As the series progressed, Kris' children Kendall and Kylie also became recurring cast members of the show. Kris' second husband[19] 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon champion Bruce Jenner, is also frequently featured on the show, and has been a recurring cast member since the show began.\n",
      "Since the series' premiere, the Kardashian sisters have established careers in the fashion industry, co-owning the fashion boutique D-A-S-H and launching several fragrances and clothing collections.\n",
      "Kim gained notoriety as the subject of a sex tape in 2007, and later became involved in a relationship with New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush from 2007- March 2010.[20] In 2011, she received widespread criticism after filing for divorce from New Jersey Nets power forward Kris Humphries after a 72-day marriage. In 2012, while still married Kim became pregnant by rapper Kanye West; after suffering from preeclampsia she gave birth prematurely to their daughter North the following June.\n",
      "Khlo\u00e9 attained notoriety in her own right after being arrested for driving under the influence in 2007, for which she was jailed for approximately three hours in 2008. The following year (during the fourth season), she married Los Angeles Lakers forward Lamar Odom after a one-month relationship. In 2012, she served as a co-host during the second season of the American version of The X Factor.\n",
      "Rob launched the sock line \"Arthur George\" in 2012, and was involved in a relationship with singer Adrienne Bailon in the second and third seasons.\n",
      "Kendall and Kylie have also established careers in the modeling industry.\n",
      "In the eighth season, Bruce's sons Brandon and Brody Jenner, and Brandon's wife Leah Felder (daughter of Eagles band member Don Felder), were integrated into the supporting cast, while Kourtney, Khlo\u00e9, and Kim's friends Malika Haqq and Jonathan Cheban joined the series in the second and third seasons.\n",
      "The family earns an alleged total of $10 million per season of the series.[21]\n",
